# JPL-Horizons-comet-database
a stupid 2-step script to import the orbital elements database of comets from JPL-Horizons and do some stupid things with it, such calculate the Tisserand parameter and doing some useful plots to visualize the different families fo comets

# How to use
execute "import_JPL_horizon_orbital_url.m"
execute "comets_plot_JPL_url.mlx"
watch the plots (lol) and explore the JFC and HFC tables created

(I've included a standard .m version of the "comets_plot_JPL_url.mlx" for easy and speedy readability)

# To do
better plots with axis legend, some notable comets highlighted, less stupid graphic choice for better readability;
include some manipulations for the LPC (Long Period Comets)
adding the Encke family? 
getting rid of the "live script" format and reformat the plotting code to show all the graphs when launching the .m file
