# JPL-Horizons-comets-database
a stupid 2-step MATLAB script for importing the orbital elements database of comets from JPL-Horizons and do some stupid things with it, such calculate the Tisserand parameter and doing some useful plots to visualize different families fo comets (if you know where to look)

# How to use
execute "import_JPL_horizon_orbital_url.m"<br>
execute "comets_plot_JPL_url.mlx"<br>
watch the plots (lol) and explore the JFC and HFC tables created<br>
<br>
(I've included a standard .m version of the "comets_plot_JPL_url.mlx" for easy and speedy readability)

# To do
better plots with axis legend, some notable comets highlighted, less stupid graphic choice for better readability;<br>
include some manipulations for the LPC (Long Period Comets);<br>
add the Encke family?/remove the Main Belt Comets thing (lol)<br>
getting rid of the "live script" format and reformat the plotting code to show all the graphs when executing the .m file<br>
